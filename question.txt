1.In order to understand how
genome complexity influences transcriptome assembly, we
used two model organisms: D. melanogaster and S. pombe,
which differed in genomic properties[comparision 2011]

2.map transcript to genome reference, need a translation from genome to transcript?

3.Mapping reads to transcripts
To get assembly statistics for the number of reads that
could be mapped back to transcripts (RMBT) , we used
bowtie (version 0.12.7) [17] to map back all input short
reads to the reconstructed transcripts, with parameters
“-q Cphred33-quals Cfr -1 fq1 -2 fq2 -v 3”.[comparision 2011]
这一步的目的是什么?

4.如何evaluate拼接rna的结果？
Expression quintiles
Short reads used for assembly were aligned to the CDS
sequences by Tophat (v1.2.0) [19], and then custom PERL
scripts were applied to computing normalized gene
expression level by calculating RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase
of exon model per Million mapped reads) of each transcript.
Only paired end mapped reads were considered in
this study. Gene was defined as expressed if it’s RPKM >0,
and then all expressed genes were divided into expression
quintiles at 10% intervals for the evaluation.

5.hwo to evaluate gene coverage and integrity of assembled
transcripts?

6.full-length transcripts? partial-length transcripts?

7.Full-length, partial-length, and fused CDS
